This project is created to patch umacruise with fabulous' english translation

## Installation

Copy releases file that contains json into UmaLibrary folder inside your umacruise folder.

## Development

To compile, simply run the main.py with entire UmaLibrary file present with main.py.

This is still an early development, I'm going to make some scripts to automatically convert the data.json into appropriate json later.

If you want to add new translation, add it into excel files, convert it into json and then run the script.
